The purpose for the analysis is to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images by using BeautifulSoup and Splinter, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, to display the data by using a web application, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images. 

This assignment consists of three following technical analyses:
  1. Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
  2. Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
  3. Add Bootstrap 3 Components.
